Super Mario Bros. 3-Do (SMB3DO)
=============================
A Super Mario Bros. 3 Fangame
---
A personal project that aims to re-imagine the classic Nintendo NES game Super Mario Bros. 3.  This project arose out of my dissatisfaction of Super Mario Maker and Super Mario Maker 2's shortcomings and limitations, particularly in the SMB3 style.  While ROM hacking is always an option, SMB3's compression makes it a particarly tricky task to mod without destroying the ROM (last time I checked).  Plus, creating my own rendition would allow me to add new features and tweak anything to my liking.  And so here we are, SMB3 remade for the modern era.

This project is written in C++14 and uses SDL2.  Currently, there is no executable build.
